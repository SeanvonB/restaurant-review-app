[LIVE PREVIEW](https://seanvonb.github.io/restaurant-reviewer/)

This was the final project of my Front End Web Developer Nanodegree from 2019. It was an opportunity to demonstrate using APIs and a service worker to create a stable, responsive web application with a simple database. Originally, my app used data provided by Udacity to feature locations in New York, but I've since updated the app to instead feature some Seattle favorites of mine and my friends. I also fixed the outdated implementation of Leaflet and restyled just about everything.

## Features

-   Locate restaurants on a live map
-   Filter restaurants by cuisine or neighborhood
-   Find restaurant details, like hours and address
-   Read sample reviews provided by my family and friends
