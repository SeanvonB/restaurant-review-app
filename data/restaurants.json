Over the years, however, I have had some pretty amazing Thai food and while Thai Siam is always satisfying I don’t think it is the best of the best. Prices are still very reasonable, though and their menu is extensive. I still would recommend it for an excellent Thai meal."

So simple and SOOO good. This time I had the Ratatouille with Parmesan polenta which was also very satisfying. Although in a new location, it’s still warm and inviting with big windows and lots of live plants, same super friendly staff."

So many holidays, birthdays, and even the occasional family gathering are celebrated around the circular rotating tables and carts of Dim Sum. As a fan of all the shrimp-themed dishes, it's always a delight to watch my family members attempt to eat the ever popular chicken feet or make a kebab out of the coconut shrimp balls. The only downside is that the parking situation is both small and complicated, but there is always a friendly parking attendant to usher you into the perfect spot."

Their signature - and my favorite - is the Kringle, a delight both for the holidays and literally any other time of the year. Always fun to see what seasonal & thematic cupcakes they have. Solid coffee game too, including a 'flavor of the day' latte. Reasonable amount of seating along the windows. Grateful this is in walking distance for me!"

We ordered one of each and everything was excellent. Perhaps focusing just on pies means you can really perfect your skills. We had a mushroom, vegetables and cheese slice and a Ballard bumble berry crumble. The former came with salad and the latter with ice cream. It was all that two people needed at a reasonable price. Great service, clean and comfortable."
